      dates="UC San Diego Class of 2020, Revelle College, B.S. Computer Science"
      description="I started programming in Middle school with Scratch (see 'Games'),
      and since then I've been improving my ability to use programming to solve problems.
      From computer science tutoring & courses in AI, Machine Learning, Computer Vision
      & Computer Security at UC San Diego to frontend & backend app development to virtual
      reality to DevOps; I'm always looking to expand my skillset and do interesting
      work along the way!"

      dates="Summer 2019"
      position="DevOps Software Development Intern"
      linkUrl="https://www.mitchell.com"
      description="I wrote a C# .NET project to automate a PSI build process:
      the logic interfaces a Microsoft TFS repository with the local file system,
      builds a dependency graph of internal packages, and updates the files in
      topological order. Then, I configured a Docker image and hosted it on AWS ECS.
      This utility helped reduce build time from ~3 days to ~3 hours."
