      linkUrl="https://www.mitchell.com"
      description="I wrote a C# .NET project to automate a PSI build process:
      checkout remote changes from a Microsoft TFS repository, modify configuration
      files to reference frozen versions instead of latest versions, build a dependency
      graph of internal packages, and update the packages in topological order.
      Then, I configured a Docker image for it to be hosted on AWS ECS.
      This utility helped reduce build time from ~3 days to ~3 hours."
